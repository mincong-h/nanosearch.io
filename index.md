## Privacy

We collect your identity from Google and OpenAI (first name, last name, email, Google picture, OpenAI user ID, OpenAI organization IDs). We also collect all the conversations that happened in ChatGPT. Your data are stored remotely in our database, located in Paris, France. We don't sell your information to any third-party partners.
