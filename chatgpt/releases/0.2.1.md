## What's new in 0.2.1

In this release, we implemented the refresh token mechanism which avoids asking users to sign in every day. Users can stay signed in for 90 days. Searching Chinese content is also supported now: this is done by using the [International Components for Unicode (ICU)](https://icu.unicode.org/) plugin for Elasticsearch. Here is an example of searching "微信" (WeChat) using the search bar.
