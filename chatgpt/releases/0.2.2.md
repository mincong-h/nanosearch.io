## What's new in 0.2.2

In this release, we fixed the access token retrieval mechanism for ChatGPT, because OpenAI changed their implementation earlier this month, so we have to adapt our logic. We also improved the information displayed on the extension popup so that users can better understand the status of his/her session, including the account connection status between OpenAI and Nanosearch, the synchronization status, the warning (required actions), and the sign-in process on Nanosearch.

## Required Actions

As an alpha-tester, you will need to sign out and sign in again to benefit from the latest changes of the extension.

## Additional Notes

As of 3 June 2024, the service is not publicly available. If you are interested in using the service, please visit the [home page of the extension](/chatgpt).
