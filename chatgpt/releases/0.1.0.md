## What's new in 0.1

ChatGPT QuickSearch Extension is a browser extension that allows you to quickly search the conversation history directly in ChatGPT by providing a search bar. You can simply press <kbd>cmd</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to trigger it.

Once you open the search bar, you can enter the query in the search bar and the extension will search results as you type. The matched content will be highlighted, regardless it's the title of the conversation or the underlying messages. You can press the arrow key up ⬆️ and down ⬇️ to navigate the results and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to visit the conversation.
