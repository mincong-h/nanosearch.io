## Visit ChatGPT

Now, visit ChatGPT (<https://chat.openai.com/>) and reload the page. This allows the extension to load the search bar to provide search features for you. Press <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> (macOS) or press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> for Windows/Linux to launch the search bar and search from your conversation history. You can press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to confirm the selection or press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to quit the search bar. As of 26 April 2024, the data synchronization is handled automatically by the extension when you load the web page of ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/). If you don't see any search results, please reload your web page of ChatGPT. Or contact us for additional help.

Now, enjoy the new search bar!
