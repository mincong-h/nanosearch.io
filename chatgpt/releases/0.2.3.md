## What's new in 0.2.3

### Error Display

In this release, we improved the issue display mechanism so that important errors can be shown directly in the search bar, while it was only shown in the popup UI which was difficult to detect. We also introduced the [Error Catalog](/chatgpt/errors/) to help you troubleshoot issues easier.

### Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy search queries are supported now. If you mistype some characters, the search bar will still return results for you. Let's say if you want to search "appartement" in French but you typed "appartment", it will show the results for you. We implemented this by changing our query system from a multi-match query to a boolean query composed of a multi-match query and a fuzzy query, which returns documents that contain terms similar to the search term, as measured by a Levenshtein edit distance.

### Observability

We improved the observability of the backend service by adding a tracing solution. It allows us to better troubleshoot issues when they happen.

## Required Actions

As an alpha-tester, you will need to sign out and sign in again to benefit from the latest changes of the extension.

## Additional Notes

As of 25 June 2024, the service is not publicly available. If you are interested in using the service, please visit the [home page of the extension](/chatgpt/).
