## What's new in 0.2

In this release, we made significant progress on search bar improvements and data synchronization. The idea is to let you use the extension as seamlessly as possible, without any additional configuration or manual operations. In the coming weeks, we are going to invite alpha testers to test our Chrome extension.

### Search Bar Improvements

A new icon üîç has been added to the main view of ChatGPT, next to the dropdown list for choosing the ChatGPT models (3.5 / 4 / 4o) so that you can trigger the search bar either by clicking the icon or using the shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>.

When navigating to the target conversation, the extension automatically scrolls the view to the target message matching the search query and highlights the matched keywords.

### Automatic Data Synchronization

The data synchronization is now triggered automatically when you load the ChatGPT web page in your browser. Previously, you had to click a button to trigger it manually. If you open the extension popup, you can also see the progress of the synchronization in real-time. The synchronization is incremental, which means that if a conversation has been synchronized in the past and is not updated, it won't be synchronized again.

You can control the data synchronization by using the shortcut <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>, to disable or enable the synchronization. You need to inspect it from the console (Press <kbd>F12</kbd> and then visit the tab "Console" in Chrome).

## Improvements

Other improvements:

* Show the version, mode, and site for the backend API in the popup, which facilitates troubleshooting when an issue occurs.
* Change the permissions of Chrome extensions to follow the DNS changes of ChatGPT from `https://chat.openai.com` to `https://chatgpt.com`.
* Improvements in API error handling, such as "504 Gateway Timeout" and "429 Too Many Requests".

## Additional Notes

As of 14 May 2024, the service is not publicly available. If you are interested in using the service, please visit the [home page of the extension](/chatgpt).
